    <h2>Honey Chipotle Dipping Sauce Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>1 chipotle pepper, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from 
        the can</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make BBQ Chicken Crispers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken breasts into strips about 3 inches long.</li>
        <li>Stir buttermilk and hot sauce together in a medium bowl. Add chicken to 
        buttermilk mixture and toss well to completely cover the chicken. Let stand 
        30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour vegetable oil into a large saucepan or very deep skillet 
        to about 4 inches deep. Heat oil to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large shallow dish, whisk together flour, kosher salt, pepper, 
        paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and baking powder until well combined.</li>
        <li>Remove each tender from buttermilk mixture and coat lightly with flour 
        mixture, shaking off any excess. Return chicken to buttermilk mixture and 
        finish with a second coat of flour mixture. Set aside on a plate. Repeat with 
        remaining chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully add chicken tenders to hot oil and cook, 
        flipping occasionally, until crispy golden brown and cooked through, about 5 
        minutes. Drain on paper towels or a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>For sauce, whisk barbecue sauce, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, and honey 
        together in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt. Serve chicken with sauce.</li>
    </ol>
